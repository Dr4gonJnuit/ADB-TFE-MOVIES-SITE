\subsection{Project overview}
The project aims to develop a web application that allows users to track movies and series they watch in a simple, centralized, and user-friendly interface. The idea comes from “Seb”, a series enthusiast who wants to better manage his watched episodes, know which platform each series is available on, and annotate personal notes while keeping track of progress.

\subsection{Project Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let users track where they left off in each series.
    \item Centralize information across streaming platforms.
    \item Provide a clean, simple, and accessible interface.
    \item Include light social features (comments, favorites).
    \item Offer fun statistics like total episodes watched.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Features}

    \item Add to favorites (heart or star icon).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Responsive web app (PC, tablet, mobile).
    \item Lightweight user experience (no login required at start).
    \item Simple database (e.g., MySQL).
    \item Clean UI with soft colors and readable fonts (e.g., WCAG norms)
